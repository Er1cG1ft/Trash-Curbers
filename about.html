        The Story:
      </h1>
      <p>
        Trash Curbers is a business founded by Ryan Michener. He and his business partners: Conner Ruyak and Tyler Kwortnik, like many others, spent their summers in OCNJ surfing and hitting the beach every day. They all went to Owen J. Roberts High School in Pennsylvania, and the group dreamed of one day helping out others in the city that they love. <br>
        The entire trio plans to study business in respected Universities throughout the country.
